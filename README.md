# Stroke-Prediction
In this case, we want to have a study around one of the critical disease “Stroke”. Stroke is a disease that affects the arteries leading to and within the brain. A stroke occurs when a blood vessel that carries oxygen and nutrients to the brain is either blocked by a clot or bursts (or ruptures). When that happens, part of the brain cannot get the blood (and oxygen) it needs, so it and brain cells die.

Over the last few years, the Client has captured several health, demographic and lifestyle details about its patients. This includes details such as age and gender, along with several health parameters (e.g. hypertension, body mass index) and lifestyle related variables (e.g. smoking status, occupation type). The Client wants us to predict the probability of stroke happening to their patients. This will help doctors take proactive health measures for these patients.Here, we are trying to predict the occurence of stroke based on the patient's medical profile and lifestyle like : age, gender, work type, average glucose level, bmi, smoking status, marriage status etc. In order to achieve this, we are using two models: parametric one(logistic regression) and non-parametric one(KNN). Our aim to build a model which will give us the maximum accuracy.
